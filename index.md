## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en),
supervised by [Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers](https://people.cispa.io/cas.cremers/). Before starting my Ph.D., I finished a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) under 
Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers and [Dr. Robert Künnemann](http://www.kunnemann.de/), and I enrolled
in the [Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/).

Together with [Aurora Naska](https://cispa.de/en/people/aurora.naska) and Cas Cremers, I have formally proven
that modern messaging apps like Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp cannot achieve
full post-compromise security for end-users while being resistant against state
loss that is caused by, for instance, an end-user losing their device.

Together with [Alexander Dax](https://www.alexanderdax.org/) and Cas Cremers, I have proposed
novel security notions for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)
in the computational model of cryptography, created new, more realistic models
for KEMs in the symbolic model of cryptography, and introduced a methodology to
analyze protocols that use KEMs using the [Tamarin Prover](https://tamarin-prover.com/).

Together with [Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter](https://benjaminkiesl.github.io/) and Cas Cremers, I have
created and proven secure an extensive formal model of IEEE's 802.11 WPA2 protocol.
